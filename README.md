# Data-Leak-Incident-and-Mitigation-Strategies

Incident Overview:
This case study explores a data leak incident caused by improper access controls. A sales manager inadvertently enabled access to sensitive internal documents, which were later shared externally due to a misunderstanding. The incident highlights the critical importance of implementing least privilege access controls and auditing processes.

# Key Details:
	1.	Incident Summary:
	•	Sensitive documents, including customer analytics and promotional materials, were shared via an unsecured link.
	•	A sales representative mistakenly shared the link externally, leading to public exposure on social media.
	2.	Control Weakness:
	•	Lack of restrictive access for internal resources.
	•	No automated revocation of permissions or regular audits of user access.
	3.	Framework Reference:
	•	The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and SP 800-53 (AC-6) guidelines for implementing least privilege were applied to analyze and resolve the issue.

# Recommendations:
	•	Restrict access to sensitive resources based on user roles.
	•	Regularly audit user privileges and automatically revoke unnecessary access.
	•	Maintain detailed logs of user activity for accountability and forensic analysis.

Security Control Highlight:
The NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 “Least Privilege” control emphasizes granting minimal access required for tasks, with enhancements such as role-based access, automatic revocation, and privilege audits.

# Key Takeaways:
	•	Proactive access management prevents unintended exposure of sensitive information.
	•	Aligning organizational security practices with frameworks like NIST CSF enhances resilience against data leaks.
